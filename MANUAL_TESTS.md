# Manual verification checklist

## Mixed-media uploads
1. Sign in and open the post composer (floating + button or sidebar button).
2. Attach up to 10 files at once, mixing images, video, audio, and documents.
3. Publish the post and confirm all attachments render in the feed and the post details page (thumbnails for images, playable media for audio/video, and download links for files).
4. Leave a comment on the post and ensure the author avatar renders correctly beside the comment.

## Avatar uploads
1. Register a new user and upload an avatar during the profile step; finish registration and check the avatar shows in the feed, comments, and profile header.
2. For an existing user, open “Редактировать профиль”, upload a new avatar, save, and verify the new avatar appears across the app (sidebar, bottom nav, posts, comments).
3. Confirm avatar URLs work whether the API returns absolute or relative `/uploads/...` links.
